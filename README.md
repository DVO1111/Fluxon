# Welcome to your  Fluxon

# ⚡️ Fluxo

**🌐 Live App:** [https://fluxonng.vercel.app](https://fluxonng.vercel.app)

Fluxon is a demo-degen social trading app built on Solana.
It lets users compete in live trading tournaments with dummy assets, zero gas fees, and real-time price feeds — all inside Ephemeral Rollups.

Imagine a gasless onchain trading arena where:

Anyone can join by paying a small entry fee

Each player gets a virtual trading balance

Rounds run for a set time (e.g., 5 or 10 minutes)

Players make real-time trades using Pyth price feeds

A live leaderboard, chatroom, and NFT trophies keep things spicy

No real liquidity. No slippage. Just speed, fun, and bragging rights — all to showcase Solana’s performance and composability.

🎮 Why It Matters


By leveraging Ephemeral Rollups, Pyth price feeds, and gasless trading logic, Fluxon creates a frictionless demo experience that:

Attracts both traders and devs

Demonstrates Solana’s tech edge

Makes onchain trading viral and community-driven

We’re turning DeFi into a spectator sport.

🧠 How It Works

Players join a round → Pay a small entry fee in SOL or USDC.

Get virtual balance → Dummy assets are credited to each wallet.

Trade in real time → Buy/sell simulated tokens using Pyth prices.

Leaderboards update live → Top-performing traders climb ranks instantly.

Round ends → Winners get rewards, XP, and collectible NFTs.

Under the hood, Ephemeral Rollups execute trades off-chain and settle results on Solana — ensuring speed, fairness, and transparency.
